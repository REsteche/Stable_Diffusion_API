### Local installation ###

To prepare the project, the following steps will be necessary:
> - Install [python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads);
> - On your local server, run a `git clone` command;
> - Download the requirements.txt file with the project dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is strongly recommended that you do it within a virtual environment .env to avoid version conflict with other packages in your base installation.).

### To run it locally ###
There are two ways to run the application locally, 
> - Open a cmd prompt inside the directory where you installed the application, and access your virtual environment (recommended) or your (base:) environment and run the command `python main.py`.
> - Install docker on your machine through [Link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), open a cmd inside your aplication directory and run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d` to create both the image and container for your aplication. 


### Feature ###

The repository features the following tool:
> - This repository contains a tool in REST API format to generate images using the public stable diffusion model trained by the hugging face company ðŸ¤—.
